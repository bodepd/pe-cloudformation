This project contains an aws cloud formation template that is capable of deploying
a cluster of nodes with puppet enterprise installed.

## Installation

The amazon cloud formation client tools can be downloaded
using the cloudformation puppet class.

The following example manifest can be found at examples/install.pp

  class { 'cloudformation':
    aws_access_key => '< your key here >',
    aws_secret_key => '< your secret key here >'
  }

Add your aws credentials to the class declaration, ensure the cloudformation module
is in your module path, and use puppet to apply the installation manifest:

  puppet apply examples/install.pp

This will install the client tools and create the file: bashrc_cfn

Configure your cfn client tools by sourcing this file:

  source bash_rc

After you source this file, verify that your cfn tools work:

  cfn-describe-stacks
